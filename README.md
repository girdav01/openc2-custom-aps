## <a id="readme-general">OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-custom-aps</a>

This GitHub public repository ( [https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-custom-aps](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-custom-aps) ) was created at the request of the [Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee's work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are [separate and distinct](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-custom-aps/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process) from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in the [Apache License v2.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/Apache-LICENSE-2.0.txt). That license was selected as the declared [Applicable License](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC Open Repository was created.

Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-custom-aps/blob/master/LICENSE) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla) that governs intellectual property.

## <a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a>

The Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository openc2-custom-aps as [approved](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=65170&wg_abbrev=openc2) by the TC: 

OpenC2 allows for actuator profiles other than those that are OASIS specifications. It allows for "extensions" by vendors or users. This repository enables interested parties to work collaboratively on Custom Actuator Profiles (CAP).

The qualifier "custom" is used to distinguish between actuator profiles being drafted as OASIS Specifications and those "custom" profiles being developed as extensions to a specification (e.g., providing vendor-specific or user-specific options) or to support a particular technology that does not yet have a specification.

The creation of OpenC2 actuator profile specifications is not necessarily a goal for this openc2-custom-aps repository, but the custom profiles in the repository may serve to inform the actuator profile subcommittee.
